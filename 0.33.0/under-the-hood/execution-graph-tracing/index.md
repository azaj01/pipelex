# Execution Graph Tracing

Pipelex captures pipeline executions as directed graphs for visualization and debugging. The `pipelex/graph/` module provides tracing infrastructure, a canonical data model (GraphSpec), and multiple rendering backends (Mermaid, ReactFlow).

---

## Design Principle

Pipeline executions form implicit graphs: pipes call other pipes, data flows between them. The graph module makes this structure explicit:

1. **Trace at runtime**: Instrument pipe execution to capture nodes (pipes) and edges (relationships)
2. **Store canonically**: GraphSpec is a versioned, renderer-agnostic JSON model
3. **Render as needed**: Transform GraphSpec into Mermaid diagrams or ReactFlow visualizations

```
Pipe Execution → GraphTracer → GraphSpec → Renderers → HTML/Mermaid
```

!!! info "Non-Intrusive Design"
    Graph tracing is opt-in. When disabled, a no-op tracer is used with zero overhead. The tracer is injected via `TraceContext` in `JobMetadata`, not global state.

---

## Usage Variants

| Scenario | CLI | API | Result |
|----------|-----|-----|--------|
| Generate execution graph | `pipelex run pipe my_pipe --graph` | `PipelexMTHDSProtocol(execution_config=...).execute(...)` | GraphSpec JSON + HTML viewers |
| Force include full data | `--graph --graph-full-data` | `data_inclusion.stuff_json_content=True` | Data embedded in IOSpec |
| Force exclude data | `--graph --graph-no-data` | All `data_inclusion.*=False` | Previews only |
| Dry run with graph | `--dry-run --graph` | `PipelexMTHDSProtocol(pipe_run_mode=PipeRunMode.DRY, execution_config=...)` | Graph of mock execution |

!!! info "Full Data Included by Default"
    The default configuration includes full data in graphs (`stuff_json_content`, `stuff_text_content`, `stuff_html_content`, and `error_stack_traces` are all `true`). Use `--graph-full-data` or `--graph-no-data` only to override project-specific settings.

---

## Interfaces

### CLI Commands

```bash
# Run pipeline and generate graph
pipelex run pipe my_pipe --graph

# Include full serialized data
pipelex run pipe my_pipe --graph --graph-full-data

# Exclude data (previews only)
pipelex run pipe my_pipe --graph --graph-no-data

# Dry run with graph tracing
pipelex run pipe my_pipe --dry-run --graph --mock-inputs
```

### API

```python
from pipelex.pipeline.runner import PipelexMTHDSProtocol
from pipelex.pipe_run.pipe_run_mode import PipeRunMode

# Execute with graph tracing via config
runner = PipelexMTHDSProtocol(
    execution_config=config.with_execution_overrides(generate_graph=True),
)
response = await runner.execute(
    pipe_code="my_pipe",
)
pipe_output = response.pipe_output

# Dry run with graph: the same runner in DRY mode with mock inputs — no separate code path.
dry_runner = PipelexMTHDSProtocol(
    pipe_run_mode=PipeRunMode.DRY,
    execution_config=config.with_execution_overrides(generate_graph=True, mock_inputs=True),
)
response = await dry_runner.execute(pipe_code="my_pipe")
graph_spec = response.pipe_output.graph_spec
```

!!! tip "Dry run from MTHDS content"
    To dry-run an entire bundle straight from MTHDS content and get back a `GraphSpec`, use `dry_run_pipeline(mthds_contents=...)` (`pipelex/pipe_run/dry_run_pipeline.py`) — the shared entrypoint behind the CLI graph commands and the API, which wires the same DRY-mode runner for you. It owns its graph transport (a scoped in-memory event log), so it produces the graph regardless of the host's `tracing_config` and never writes trace files as a side effect.

## Core Components

### GraphSpec

The canonical, versioned data model for execution graphs. Designed for JSON serialization and renderer-agnostic storage.

```python
class GraphSpec(BaseModel):
    graph_id: str
    created_at: datetime
    pipeline_ref: PipelineRef
    nodes: list[NodeSpec]
    edges: list[EdgeSpec]
    meta: dict[str, Any]

    def to_json(self) -> str:
        return self.model_dump_json(by_alias=True, indent=2)
```

### Node Types

| NodeKind | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `PIPE_CALL` | Generic pipe invocation |
| `CONTROLLER` | PipeController (Sequence, Parallel, etc.) |
| `OPERATOR` | PipeOperator (LLM, Extract, etc.) |
| `INPUT` | Pipeline input node |
| `OUTPUT` | Pipeline output node |
| `ARTIFACT` | Generated artifact |
| `ERROR` | Error node |

### Edge Types

| EdgeKind | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `CONTROL` | Execution flow between pipes |
| `DATA` | Data flow (stuff passed between pipes) |
| `CONTAINS` | Parent-child containment (controller → children) |
| `SELECTED_OUTCOME` | Condition outcome selection |

### Node Status

| NodeStatus | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `SCHEDULED` | Not yet started |
| `RUNNING` | Currently executing |
| `SUCCEEDED` | Completed successfully |
| `FAILED` | Execution failed |
| `SKIPPED` | Skipped during execution |
| `CANCELED` | Canceled before completion |

---

## Implementation

### Tracing Flow

```python
# 1. Manager opens tracer for pipeline run
manager = GraphTracerManager.get_or_create_instance()
trace_context = manager.open_tracer(
    graph_id=pipeline_run_id,
    data_inclusion=config.data_inclusion,
    pipeline_ref_domain="my_domain",
    pipeline_ref_main_pipe="my_pipe",
)

# 2. Context flows through JobMetadata to each pipe
job_metadata = JobMetadata(
    pipeline_run_id=pipeline_run_id,
    trace_context=trace_context,
)

# 3. Each pipe reports start/end to tracer
node_id, child_context = manager.on_pipe_start(
    trace_context=trace_context,
    pipe_code="extract_text",
    pipe_type="PipeExtract",
    node_kind=NodeKind.OPERATOR,
    started_at=datetime.now(timezone.utc),
    input_specs=[...],
)

# 4. On completion, report success with output
manager.on_pipe_end_success(
    graph_id=trace_context.graph_id,
    node_id=node_id,
    ended_at=datetime.now(timezone.utc),
    output_spec=IOSpec(...),
)

# 5. Manager closes tracer and returns GraphSpec
graph_spec = manager.close_tracer(pipeline_run_id)
```

### Event-Log Transport and the Scoped Override

Trace events travel through an `EventLogProtocol` backend (`pipelex/tracing/`): the tracer emits events into it during the run (write side, wired in `pipeline_run_setup`), and `assemble_tracing` reads them back after the run to build the `GraphSpec` and usage aggregates (read side, triggered from `PipeRun.run`). Both sides normally build their backend instance independently from `tracing_config` via `make_event_log` — NDJSON files or DynamoDB bridge the two instances through external storage.

For fully in-process runs, `pipelex.hub.scoped_event_log` pins one shared instance for both sides instead:

```python
from pipelex.hub import scoped_event_log
from pipelex.tracing.in_memory_event_log import InMemoryEventLog

with scoped_event_log(InMemoryEventLog()):
    response = await runner.execute_pipeline(...)  # graph assembles in memory
```

Semantics:

- The override is ContextVar-scoped (mirrors `scoped_pipe_router`), so concurrent runs with separate scopes never cross-contaminate, and the prior value is restored on exit.
- A set override **implies tracing-enabled**: it is honored even when `tracing_config.is_enabled` is `False`, on both the write side and the read side's early-return.
- Lifecycle: the read side does not `close()` the scoped instance and the machinery never calls `cleanup()` on it — but the write-side tracer DOES call `close()` on its event log at teardown, before the read side assembles. A scoped event log's `close()` must therefore be idempotent or a no-op (as `InMemoryEventLog`'s is); scoping a backend whose `close()` releases a real resource would break its own assembly read.

This is what lets a graph-producing dry-run trace entirely in memory (no NDJSON file, no DynamoDB round-trip). Both dry-run entrypoints in `pipelex/pipe_run/dry_run_pipeline.py` rely on it: `dry_run_pipe_in_process` (validation and graph dry-run hosted inside a single Temporal activity) and `dry_run_pipeline` itself — these functions exist to produce a graph, so they install their own scoped `InMemoryEventLog` rather than depending on the host having tracing configured (a host with `tracing_config.is_enabled = false`, like pipelex-api's `/validate` in direct mode, still gets its graph). A run that nonetheless finishes without a graph raises the typed `DryRunGraphNotProducedError`.

### TraceContext Propagation

TraceContext is a serializable context that flows through pipe execution:

```python
class TraceContext(BaseModel):
    graph_id: str                           # Unique graph identifier
    parent_node_id: str | None              # Parent pipe's node ID
    node_sequence: int                      # Counter for generating node IDs
    data_inclusion: DataInclusionConfig     # What data to capture

    def copy_for_child(self, child_node_id: str, next_sequence: int) -> TraceContext:
        """Create context for nested pipe execution."""
        return TraceContext(
            graph_id=self.graph_id,
            parent_node_id=child_node_id,
            node_sequence=next_sequence,
            data_inclusion=self.data_inclusion,
        )
```

### Producer/Consumer Paradigm

Data flow in the graph follows a producer/consumer model:

- **Producers**: Nodes that create or output data (stuff). When a pipe outputs a value, it becomes the producer of that data item.
- **Consumers**: Nodes that receive or use data as input. When a pipe takes a value as input, it becomes a consumer of that data item.

Each piece of data is identified by a **digest** (a unique hash). This allows the tracer to track where data originates and where it flows, even when the same value passes through multiple pipes.

```
Producer Node ──(outputs)──► Stuff (digest: abc123) ──(inputs)──► Consumer Node
```

This paradigm enables:

- Automatic DATA edge generation without explicit wiring
- Visualization of data lineage across the execution graph
- Debugging by tracing which pipe produced unexpected output

### Data Flow Edge Generation

DATA edges are generated at teardown by correlating input/output digests:

```python
def _generate_data_edges(self) -> None:
    for consumer_node_id, node_data in self._nodes.items():
        for input_spec in node_data.input_specs:
            if input_spec.digest is None:
                continue
            producer_node_id = self._stuff_producer_map.get(input_spec.digest)
            if producer_node_id and producer_node_id != consumer_node_id:
                self.add_edge(
                    source_node_id=producer_node_id,
                    target_node_id=consumer_node_id,
                    edge_kind=EdgeKind.DATA,
                    label=input_spec.name,
                )
```

## GraphAnalysis

Pre-computed analysis layer that extracts common information for renderers:

```python
analysis = GraphAnalysis.from_graphspec(graph_spec)

# Lookups
node = analysis.nodes_by_id["node_123"]
children = analysis.get_children("controller_node")
is_root = analysis.is_root("node_123")

# Data flow
stuff_info = analysis.get_stuff_info(digest="abc123")
producer = analysis.get_producer(digest="abc123")
consumers = analysis.get_consumers(digest="abc123")
```

| Attribute | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `nodes_by_id` | Fast node lookup by ID |
| `containment_tree` | Parent → children mapping |
| `child_node_ids` | All nodes that have parents |
| `controller_node_ids` | Nodes with children |
| `root_nodes` | Top-level nodes |
| `stuff_registry` | Digest → StuffInfo |
| `stuff_producers` | Digest → producer node ID |
| `stuff_consumers` | Digest → consumer node IDs |

---

## Rendering

### Mermaidflow

Converts GraphSpec to Mermaid flowchart syntax with controller subgraphs:

```python
from pipelex.graph.mermaidflow.mermaidflow_factory import MermaidflowFactory

mermaidflow = MermaidflowFactory.make_from_graphspec(
    graph_spec,
    graph_config,
    direction=FlowchartDirection.TOP_DOWN,
    include_subgraphs=True,
)

print(mermaidflow.mermaid_code)
```

**Output structure:**

- Controllers rendered as subgraphs
- Operators rendered as rectangles inside subgraphs
- Stuff nodes (data items) rendered as stadium shapes
- DATA edges connect producers → stuff → consumers

### ReactFlow HTML

ReactFlow HTML is generated directly from GraphSpec — no intermediate ViewSpec layer. The HTML generator embeds GraphSpec as JSON and the client-side JavaScript handles dataflow analysis, layout, and rendering.

## IOSpec Data Capture

IOSpec captures input/output data for nodes:

```python
class IOSpec(BaseModel):
    name: str                    # Variable name
    concept: str | None          # Concept code
    content_type: str | None     # MIME type
    preview: str | None          # Truncated preview (max 200 chars)
    size: int | None             # Content size
    digest: str | None           # Unique identifier for data flow
    data: Any | None             # Full serialized content
    data_text: str | None        # ASCII text representation
    data_html: str | None        # HTML representation
```

!!! warning "Preview Truncation"
    Previews are automatically truncated to 200 characters. Stack traces are truncated to 2000 characters. Use `--graph-full-data` to capture complete content.

---
