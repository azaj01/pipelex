# Configuration

## Overview

Pipelex uses a TOML-based configuration system with **shipped defaults** plus **project-level overrides**.

- **Shipped defaults**: Pipelex ships default values that are maintained in the Pipelex repository (contributors will see them in the repo root `pipelex.toml`). This is the baseline used by the installed package.
- **Project overrides**: a project that *uses* Pipelex typically customizes behavior via files created in `.pipelex/`.

You can create the project configuration files by running:

```bash
pipelex init config
```

!!! important "Configuration Setup Notes"
    1. `pipelex init config` creates a **template** configuration file with sample settings. It does not include all possible configuration options - it's meant as a starting point.
    2. Running `pipelex init config` will **overwrite** your existing `pipelex.toml` file without warning. Make sure to backup your configuration before running this command.

For a complete list of all possible configuration options, refer to the configuration group documentation below.

## Where to edit configuration in a project

The main project configuration files are:

- `.pipelex/pipelex.toml`: project customization (logging, reporting, feature flags, etc.)
- `.pipelex/telemetry.toml`: custom telemetry destinations
- `.pipelex/inference/…`: inference backends, routing profiles, and model presets

## Overrides (advanced)

In addition to `.pipelex/pipelex.toml`, Pipelex can apply override files at the **project root** (not in `.pipelex/`) for machine- and environment-specific settings:

1. `pipelex_local.toml`
2. `pipelex_{environment}.toml` (example: `pipelex_dev.toml`) — selected by the `PIPELEX_ENV` environment variable (see [Selecting the environment](#selecting-the-environment))
3. `pipelex_{run_mode}.toml` (example: `pipelex_normal.toml`; unit tests may use `tests/pipelex_unit_test.toml`)
4. `pipelex_override.toml` (recommended to gitignore)

## Configuration Structure

The configuration is organized into three main sections:

1. `[pipelex]` - Core Pipelex settings
2. `[cogt]` - Cognitive tools and LLM settings
3. `[plugins]` - Plugin-specific configurations

Each section contains multiple subsections for specific features and functionalities.

## Configuration Override System

Pipelex uses a sophisticated configuration override system that loads and merges configurations in a specific order. This allows for fine-grained control over settings in different environments and scenarios.

The exact loading sequence is:

1. Base configuration from the installed Pipelex package (`pipelex.toml`)
2. Your project's base configuration (`pipelex.toml` in your project root)
3. Local overrides (`pipelex_local.toml`)
4. Environment-specific overrides (`pipelex_{environment}.toml`)
   - Example environments: `local`, `dev`, `staging`, `prod` — selected by the `PIPELEX_ENV` environment variable (see [Selecting the environment](#selecting-the-environment))
5. Run mode overrides (`pipelex_{run_mode}.toml`)
   - Example run modes: normal, unit_test
6. Final overrides (`pipelex_override.toml`) (recommended to put in .gitignore)

Each subsequent configuration file in this sequence can override settings from the previous ones. This means:

- Settings in `pipelex_local.toml` override the base configuration
- Environment-specific settings override local settings
- Run mode settings override environment settings
- Super user settings override all previous settings

### Override File Naming

- Base config: `pipelex.toml`
- Local overrides: `pipelex_local.toml`
- Environment overrides: `pipelex_dev.toml`, `pipelex_staging.toml`, `pipelex_prod.toml`, etc.
- Run mode overrides: `pipelex_normal.toml`, `tests/pipelex_unit_test.toml`, etc.
- Final overrides: `pipelex_override.toml`

NB: The run_mode unit_test is used for testing purposes.

### Selecting the environment

The `pipelex_{environment}.toml` overlay is picked at runtime from the `PIPELEX_ENV` environment variable.

| Value     | Overlay file loaded   |
| --------- | --------------------- |
| `local`   | `pipelex_local.toml` *(also loaded as the local override layer; see above)* |
| `dev`     | `pipelex_dev.toml`     |
| `staging` | `pipelex_staging.toml` |
| `prod`    | `pipelex_prod.toml`    |

If `PIPELEX_ENV` is unset, Pipelex defaults to `dev`. Any other value raises an error at startup — the accepted values are defined by the `RunEnvironment` enum in `pipelex/system/runtime.py`.

The selected environment is also stamped on OpenTelemetry spans as `deployment.environment`, so it doubles as the environment label for traces and metrics.

Set it the way you set any other env var — for example, in your shell, your `.env` file, your CI configuration, or your container runtime:

```bash
export PIPELEX_ENV=staging
```

### Best Practices for Overrides

1. Use the base `pipelex.toml` for default settings
2. Use `pipelex_local.toml` for machine-specific settings
3. Use environment files for environment-specific settings (dev, staging, prod)
4. Use run mode files for normal or unit_test configurations
5. Use `pipelex_override.toml` sparingly, only for temporary overrides (add to .gitignore)

## Best Practices

1. **Version Control**: Include your base `pipelex.toml` in version control
2. **Environment Overrides**: Use environment-specific files for sensitive or environment-dependent settings
3. **Documentation**: Comment any custom settings for team reference
4. **Validation**: Run `pipelex validate --all` after making configuration changes
5. **Gitignore**: Add local and sensitive override files to `.gitignore`
