# Architecture Overview

Pipelex is a Python framework for building and running **executable AI methods** using a declarative language (`.mthds` files).

---

## Two-Layer Architecture

Pipelex separates concerns into two distinct layers:

1. **High-Level**: Business logic and orchestration
2. **Low-Level**: Cognitive tools (COGT) and AI inference

This separation allows pipeline authors to focus on *what* should happen, while the framework handles *how* to interact with AI providers.

---

## High-Level: Business Logic & Orchestration

### PipeControllers (Orchestrators)

Located in [`pipelex/pipe_controllers/`](https://github.com/Pipelex/pipelex/tree/main/pipelex/pipe_controllers)

Controllers manage execution flow without performing work themselves:

- **PipeSequence** - Execute pipes one after another
- **PipeParallel** - Execute pipes concurrently
- **PipeBatch** - Process collections of items
- **PipeCondition** - Branch based on conditions

### PipeOperators (Workers)

Located in [`pipelex/pipe_operators/`](https://github.com/Pipelex/pipelex/tree/main/pipelex/pipe_operators)

Operators perform concrete actions:

- **PipeLLM** - Generate text or structured data via LLMs
- **PipeExtract** - Extract content from documents (OCR, parsing)
- **PipeImgGen** - Generate images
- **PipeFunc** - Execute custom Python functions
- **PipeCompose** - Compose content from templates or construct structured objects
- **PipeSearch** - Search the web for information

What an operator *does* — model-deck resolution, prompt assembly, generation, memory write-back — lives one layer down in [`pipelex/kernel/`](https://github.com/Pipelex/pipelex/tree/main/pipelex/kernel), as plain functions that take everything method-specific as an explicit argument and read only the kernel-layer services a boot stands up, such as the model deck and the content generator. The operator classes above hold what is specific to being a step in a method: blueprint resolution, input validation, error context, and execution-graph tracing. The split exists so the same semantics can be called without a loaded method, and so there is one implementation rather than two that drift. See [The Pipelex Kernel](./pipelex-kernel.md) for the layering contract, what a programmatic caller imports, and how it boots.

### Core Domain

Located in [`pipelex/core/`](https://github.com/Pipelex/pipelex/tree/main/pipelex/core)

- **Concepts** - Semantic types with meaning (not just data types)
- **Stuffs** - Knowledge objects combining a concept type with content
- **Working Memory** - Runtime storage for data flowing through pipes
- **Bundles** - Complete pipeline definitions loaded from `.mthds` files

---

## Low-Level: Cognitive Tools (COGT) & Inference

### COGT Layer

Located in [`pipelex/cogt/`](https://github.com/Pipelex/pipelex/tree/main/pipelex/cogt)

The COGT layer abstracts AI provider details from business logic:

- **LLM Workers** - Prompt construction, structured output, templating
- **Extract Workers** - Document processing and OCR
- **Image Generation Workers** - Image creation
- **Search Workers** - Web search and information retrieval
- **Model Catalog & Model Deck** - Manages available models, aliases, and presets
- **Content Generation** - Unified generation interface

!!! note "Why COGT?"
    COGT stands for "Cognitive Tools". This layer lets you swap AI providers without touching your pipeline definitions.

### Plugin System

Two packages, one for the mechanism and one for the built-in adapters:

- [`pipelex/plugins/`](https://github.com/Pipelex/pipelex/tree/main/pipelex/plugins) — the plugin **mechanism**: the `PipelexPlugin` contract, the registrar every plugin registers into, and the capability registries. This is what an out-of-tree plugin imports, and what the `pipelex.plugins.kernel` / `pipelex.plugins.interpreter` entry points resolve against.
- [`pipelex/providers/`](https://github.com/Pipelex/pipelex/tree/main/pipelex/providers) — the built-in **provider adapters**, one directory per vendor, each handling that vendor's API specifics:

    - OpenAI
    - Anthropic
    - Google (Gemini)
    - Mistral
    - AWS Bedrock
    - And more...

The dependency runs one way: adapters depend on the mechanism, never the reverse. Each adapter translates Pipelex's unified interface into provider-specific API calls.

## What Keeps The Layers Apart: The Two Hubs

The two layers above would be a diagram rather than an architecture if nothing enforced the split. What enforces it is the **hub** — the mechanism every component uses to reach a shared dependency (the config, a model deck, the pipe library) without importing the module that owns it.

There are two hubs, and the boundary between them *is* the boundary between the layers:

- [**`pipelex/runtime_hub.py`**](https://github.com/Pipelex/pipelex/tree/main/pipelex/runtime_hub.py) — process-scoped infrastructure. Config, console, secrets, storage, telemetry, the model deck, the inference workers, the content generator, the plugin registries. Configured once at boot; identical for every method the process runs.
- [**`pipelex/interpreter_hub.py`**](https://github.com/Pipelex/pipelex/tree/main/pipelex/interpreter_hub.py) — library-scoped method machinery. The library manager and the concept/domain/pipe libraries, the current-library binding, the pipe router, the pipeline manager, the PipeFunc executor. Tied to the method that is loaded.

One rule governs them:

!!! note "The one arrow"
    `interpreter_hub` imports `runtime_hub`. **`runtime_hub` never imports `interpreter_hub`.**

The practical consequence is that the kernel layer cannot reach the interpreter layer. Importing the inference stack loads no `libraries`, `pipe_operators`, `pipe_controllers`, or `codegen` module at all — so anything that just wants a secret, the console, or the model deck (a health check, `pipelex --version`, a plugin's registration module) does not pay for the method interpreter, and a change to a pipe blueprint structurally cannot perturb the import graph of `cogt`.

That is not a convention held up by review: `make check-hub-layering` fails the build if a kernel-layer module imports — or merely names in a string — the interpreter hub, and an import-closure test pins the property itself in a subprocess.

`pipelex/core/` sits on both sides of the line, deliberately. Its data model — concepts, domains, stuffs, working memory, the input/output specs — belongs to the kernel layer: it describes what a method's values *are*, needs no loaded method, and takes the concept or pipe it needs as an injected argument. Everything in `core/` that names a **`Pipe`** belongs to the interpreter layer, because a pipe is the interpreter's own object.
