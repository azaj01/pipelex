# Telemetry Configuration

## Overview

Telemetry configuration is stored in `.pipelex/telemetry.toml`. This file controls **your custom telemetry** destinations—where you want to send observability data for your own analytics and monitoring.

!!! info "Two Telemetry Streams"
    Pipelex has two independent telemetry streams:

    1. **Gateway Telemetry** (Pipelex-controlled): Automatic when using Pipelex Gateway, tied to your API key
    2. **Custom Telemetry** (User-controlled): Configured in this file, sent to your own backends

    For an overview, see [Telemetry Setup](../../setup/telemetry.md).

## Configuration File Location

```
.pipelex/telemetry.toml
```

This file is created when you run `pipelex init telemetry` or `pipelex init`.

### Global vs project config

Telemetry config is layered: a project `.pipelex/telemetry.toml` is merged **on top of** the user's global `~/.pipelex/telemetry.toml`, not as a replacement. The load order is:

1. `~/.pipelex/telemetry.toml`
2. `~/.pipelex/telemetry_override.toml`
3. `{project_root}/.pipelex/telemetry.toml` *(if it exists and the project dir is distinct from the global dir)*
4. `{project_root}/.pipelex/telemetry_override.toml` *(same condition)*

Files are deep-merged, with later layers winning per leaf key. This means Langfuse keys or OTLP endpoints declared once in `~/.pipelex/telemetry.toml` keep applying across every project — a project file can override specific keys without redeclaring the rest.

!!! info "Project telemetry.toml is empty by default"
    To make the layering above actually work, `pipelex init` (when targeting a project's `.pipelex/`) drops in a **fully commented-out template**. Every section is present as documentation, but no key is set. This is deliberate: a value defined in the project file would otherwise override your global setting. Uncomment a key in the project template only when you want this project to diverge from your global telemetry config. Global init (`~/.pipelex/`) gets the active template with real defaults.

!!! note "List merge behavior"
    The `[[otlp]]` array and the `redact_properties` list do not concatenate across layers — the later layer replaces the whole list. If you want to add an OTLP exporter on top of the global set, redeclare all exporters in the layer that wins.

## PostHog Configuration

The `[custom_posthog]` section configures event tracking and optional AI span tracing to your own PostHog instance.

### `[custom_posthog]` Settings

| Setting | Type | Default | Description |
|---------|------|---------|-------------|
| `mode` | string | `"off"` | Telemetry mode: `"off"`, `"anonymous"`, or `"identified"` |
| `user_id` | string | (none) | Required when `mode = "identified"`. The identity for events that have no run — a run reports under its own caller |
| `endpoint` | string | `"https://us.i.posthog.com"` | PostHog endpoint URL |
| `api_key` | string | (required) | Your PostHog project API key |
| `geoip` | boolean | `true` | Enable GeoIP lookup for location data |
| `debug` | boolean | `false` | Log events locally without sending |
| `redact_properties` | array | `[]` | Event properties to redact before sending |

#### Mode Options

- **`"off"`**: No events sent to your PostHog
- **`"anonymous"`**: Events sent without user identification. This covers your users too, and yourself: a run's own caller is never identified, its `extras` are never sent as groups, and a `user_id` left in the file is not sent either
- **`"identified"`**: Events and spans produced during a run are attributed to that run's caller, with its `extras` attached as groups. Your `user_id` is what everything else reports under — an event outside any run, and a run that names no distinguishable caller, which is every run on your own machine. The extras ride either way: a run may carry them without naming a caller

See [Telemetry Setup](../../setup/telemetry.md) for how a run supplies its caller and its groups.

### `[custom_posthog.tracing]` Settings

Controls AI span tracing to your PostHog instance.

| Setting | Type | Default | Description |
|---------|------|---------|-------------|
| `enabled` | boolean | `false` | Send AI spans to your PostHog |

### `[custom_posthog.tracing.capture]` Settings

Privacy controls for what data is included in spans sent to **your** PostHog.

| Setting | Type | Default | Description |
|---------|------|---------|-------------|
| `content` | boolean | `false` | Capture prompt/completion content |
| `content_max_length` | integer | (unlimited) | Max length for captured content |
| `pipe_codes` | boolean | `false` | Include pipe codes in span names/attributes |
| `output_class_names` | boolean | `false` | Include output class names in spans |

!!! warning "Privacy Note"
    These capture settings only affect data sent to **your** PostHog. Langfuse and OTLP exporters always receive full span data without redaction.

---

## Portkey SDK Configuration

The `[custom_portkey]` section configures the Portkey SDK behavior when using a custom Portkey backend (not the Pipelex Gateway).

### `[custom_portkey]` Settings

| Setting | Type | Default | Description |
|---------|------|---------|-------------|
| `force_debug_enabled` | boolean | `false` | Force-enable Portkey SDK debug mode regardless of backend setting |
| `force_tracing_enabled` | boolean | `false` | Force-enable Portkey SDK tracing regardless of backend setting |

!!! info "When to Use"
    These settings are useful when you want to enable Portkey debugging or tracing globally without modifying individual backend configurations.

---

## Langfuse Configuration

The `[langfuse]` section enables integration with [Langfuse](https://langfuse.com/) for LLM observability.

| Setting | Type | Default | Description |
|---------|------|---------|-------------|
| `enabled` | boolean | `false` | Enable Langfuse integration |
| `endpoint` | string | `"https://cloud.langfuse.com"` | Langfuse endpoint (override for self-hosted) |
| `public_key` | string | (required if enabled) | Langfuse public key |
| `secret_key` | string | (required if enabled) | Langfuse secret key |

!!! info "Full Data"
    Langfuse receives **full span data** including prompts, completions, and all metadata. There is no redaction applied.

---

## OTLP Exporters Configuration

The `[[otlp]]` section is an **array** that allows you to configure multiple OpenTelemetry Protocol exporters.

| Setting | Type | Default | Description |
|---------|------|---------|-------------|
| `name` | string | (required) | Identifier for logging |
| `endpoint` | string | (required) | OTLP endpoint URL |
| `headers` | object | `{}` | HTTP headers for authentication |

### Example: Multiple OTLP Exporters

```toml
[[otlp]]
name = "datadog"
endpoint = "https://trace.agent.datadoghq.com/v1/traces"
headers = { "DD-API-KEY" = "${DD_API_KEY}" }

[[otlp]]
name = "honeycomb"
endpoint = "https://api.honeycomb.io/v1/traces"
headers = { "x-honeycomb-team" = "${HONEYCOMB_API_KEY}" }
```

!!! info "Full Data"
    OTLP exporters receive **full span data** including prompts, completions, and all metadata. There is no redaction applied.

---

## Environment Variable Substitution

All string values in `telemetry.toml` support environment variable substitution using the `${VAR_NAME}` syntax:

```toml
[custom_posthog]
endpoint = "${POSTHOG_ENDPOINT}"
api_key = "${POSTHOG_API_KEY}"

[langfuse]
public_key = "${LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY}"
secret_key = "${LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY}"

[[otlp]]
headers = { Authorization = "Bearer ${OTLP_AUTH_TOKEN}" }
```

This allows you to keep sensitive credentials in environment variables or `.env` files rather than committing them to version control.

### Variable Syntax Options

| Syntax | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `${VAR_NAME}` | Use secrets provider (default: environment variable) |
| `${env:VAR_NAME}` | Force environment variable |
| `${secret:VAR_NAME}` | Force secrets provider |
| `${env:VAR\|secret:FALLBACK}` | Try env first, then secret as fallback |

---

## DO_NOT_TRACK Override

The `DO_NOT_TRACK` environment variable disables **all** telemetry globally:

```bash
# Linux/macOS
export DO_NOT_TRACK=1

# Windows PowerShell
$env:DO_NOT_TRACK = "1"

# Windows CMD
set DO_NOT_TRACK=1
```

When set, this disables:

- All custom telemetry (PostHog, Langfuse, OTLP)
- Gateway telemetry (note: outside a test run, Gateway won't work without telemetry — see [Telemetry Setup](../../setup/telemetry.md#1-gateway-telemetry-pipelex-controlled))

---

## When telemetry.toml will not load

Pipelex tells you which of the two situations you are in, because the fix is different.

**Your file is out of date.** The settings are fine, the shape they are written in has moved on. Pipelex boots anyway — it carries the file forward in memory and warns you — and `pipelex doctor` reports the telemetry row as out of date. Make it permanent with:

```bash
pipelex migrate
```

That rewrites the file into the current shape and **keeps every setting that still has a home in it** — your PostHog key, your Langfuse credentials, your OTLP exporters. The few flat-format settings the current shape retired (`respect_dnt`, for one: `DO_NOT_TRACK` is now honoured unconditionally) are dropped, and the ledger entry names each of them and why. It backs the file up first. See [the migration ledger](../../migration-ledger.md) for what it does and does not touch.

**Your file is wrong.** A setting that is not a setting, a value outside what it accepts, or TOML that does not parse. The error names the fields; correct them in `telemetry.toml`. No command fixes this one, because nothing but you knows what you meant.

## Resetting Configuration

To start over — **discarding every setting in the file**, which is why it is not the answer to either situation above:

```bash
rm .pipelex/telemetry.toml
pipelex init telemetry
```

---

## Privacy and Compliance

- **Custom telemetry** gives you full control over what data is captured and where it's sent
- **PostHog tracing** includes granular privacy controls via the `capture` settings
- **Langfuse and OTLP** receive full data—configure these only if you're comfortable with that
- The `DO_NOT_TRACK` environment variable provides a global kill switch
