# Pipelex Plugin

The Pipelex plugin is how you build methods with your coding agent, Claude Code or Codex: it gives your agent the skills that write and run them, a hook that checks every edit, and the Pipelex tools. It works against the hosted Pipelex API, so you need an account at [app.pipelex.com](https://app.pipelex.com) and an API key from your console there.

Its source, its full documentation and its release notes are at [github.com/Pipelex/pipelex-plugins](https://github.com/Pipelex/pipelex-plugins).

## Install

=== "Claude Code"

    ```bash
    claude plugin marketplace add Pipelex/pipelex-plugins
    claude plugin install pipelex@pipelex-plugins
    ```

    Claude Code asks for an API key when you enable the plugin, and stores it in your OS keychain — create one in your console at [app.pipelex.com](https://app.pipelex.com). The skills, the hook that checks every edit and the Pipelex tools load with it. The plugin's hook and the Pipelex tools run on Node.js, so you need Node.js on your `PATH`.

    Claude Code also loads what you have added to your Claude account, so if you added the Pipelex MCP to Claude, Claude Code has it too. An agent with the plugin does not need the Pipelex MCP, and there is nothing to turn off: when both are present, the Pipelex MCP defers to the plugin's tools.

=== "Codex"

    ```bash
    codex plugin marketplace add Pipelex/pipelex-plugins
    export PIPELEX_API_KEY=plx_sk_...     # create one in your console at app.pipelex.com
    ```

    Restart Codex, run `/plugins` to install `pipelex`, and trust the plugin hook on first run. Requires Codex 0.141 or later. The plugin's hook and the Pipelex tools run on Node.js, so you need Node.js on your `PATH`.

Then ask your agent for the method you want, as in step 3 of the [Quick Start](../get-started/quick-start.md#3-ask-your-agent-for-the-method-you-want).

## Skills

Your agent picks the skill your request calls for, and you can also name one yourself.

| Skill | What it does |
|-------|--------------|
| `/pipelex-design` | Designs a method contract-first and writes it as `.mthds` files |
| `/pipelex-edit` | Makes an edit that keeps a method's contract, and proves it with a validation before and after |
| `/pipelex-organize` | Regroups a method's files into a layout you can browse, without changing what the method does |
| `/pipelex-explain` | Explains a method in plain language — its contract, its flow and every pipe — and writes nothing |
| `/pipelex-inputs` | Prepares a method's inputs from your files, from synthetic data or from a template |
| `/pipelex-synthetic-inputs` | Makes the test files a method needs when you have none |
| `/pipelex-run` | Runs a method on the hosted Pipelex API and follows the run to its status, its results and its files |
| `/pipelex-catalog` | Saves a method to your Pipelex account, lists what is saved there, and pulls a saved method back to disk |
| `/pipelex-lab` | Frames a use case into candidate methods, then runs, scores and fixes them round after round within a budget you agree |
| `/pipelex-integrate` | Wires a method into your TypeScript or Python code, with generated types and one typed call through an SDK |
| `/pipelex-scaffold` | Starts a new project around a method, such as a web app from the method-app template |

[Each skill in detail, and what it needs](https://github.com/Pipelex/pipelex-plugins/blob/main/docs/skills.md).

## The hook

After every edit to a `.mthds` file, the hook lints it and formats it in place on your machine, offline, then validates the whole method on the hosted Pipelex API when a key is set. A failed check returns to your agent with the line to fix. Without a key, the hook still lints and formats every edit and skips only the validation. [How the hook works](https://github.com/Pipelex/pipelex-plugins/blob/main/docs/hooks.md).

## The Pipelex tools

The tools the skills call to validate a method, prepare its inputs, run it, generate typed code and reach your saved methods start with your agent, on Node.js. [The tools, one by one](https://github.com/Pipelex/pipelex-plugins/blob/main/docs/skills.md#the-pipelex-tools).
