# PipeCondition

The `PipeCondition` controller adds branching logic to your pipelines. It evaluates an expression and, based on the string result, chooses which subsequent pipe to execute from a map of possibilities.

## How it works

`PipeCondition` is a routing mechanism. Its execution flow is as follows:

1.  **Evaluate an Expression**: It takes an expression and renders it using Jinja2, with the full `WorkingMemory` available as context. This evaluation results in a simple string.
2.  **Look Up in the Outcome Map**: The resulting string is used as a key to find a corresponding outcome in `outcomes` — the name of a pipe to execute, or a special outcome (`continue` / `fail`).
3.  **Use Default**: If the key is not found in `outcomes`, the `default_outcome` is used.
4.  **Execute Chosen Pipe**: The chosen pipe is then executed. It receives the exact same `WorkingMemory` and inputs that were passed to the `PipeCondition` operator. The output of the chosen pipe becomes the output of the `PipeCondition` itself.

## Configuration

`PipeCondition` is configured in your pipeline's `.mthds` file.

!!! important "Output Concept Matching"
    The output concept of the `PipeCondition` has to match the output of all the pipes in the `outcomes`.

### Example: Simple routing based on category

Here's a basic example showing how PipeCondition routes based on input data:

```toml
domain = "routing_example"
description = "Example of PipeCondition routing"

[concept.CategoryInput]
description = "Input with a category field"

[concept.CategoryInput.structure]
category = "The category of the input"

# Define the PipeCondition first
[pipe.route_by_category]
type = "PipeCondition"
description = "Route based on category field"
inputs = { input_data = "CategoryInput" }
output = "native.Text"
expression = "input_data.category"
default_outcome = "fail"

[pipe.route_by_category.outcomes]
small = "process_small"
medium = "process_medium"
large = "process_large"

# Define the pipes that PipeCondition can route to
[pipe.process_small]
type = "PipeLLM"
description = "Handle small category"
output = "native.Text"
prompt = """
Output this only: "small"
"""

[pipe.process_medium]
type = "PipeLLM"
description = "Handle medium category"
output = "native.Text"
prompt = """
Output this only: "medium"
"""

[pipe.process_large]
type = "PipeLLM"
description = "Handle large category"
output = "native.Text"
prompt = """
Output this only: "large"
"""
```

How this works:
1. `PipeCondition` receives input data with a `category` field (e.g., `{category: "small"}`)
2. It evaluates the expression `"input_data.category"` which results in the string `"small"`
3. It looks up `"small"` in the `outcomes` and finds the corresponding pipe: `"process_small"`
4. The `process_small` pipe is executed with the same working memory
5. The output from `process_small` becomes the output of the entire `PipeCondition`

### Example: Routing with default fallback

```toml
[pipe.route_with_fallback]
type = "PipeCondition"
description = "Route with default handling"
inputs = { classification = "DocumentType" }
output = "ProcessedDocument"
expression = "classification.type"
default_outcome = "process_unknown"

[pipe.route_with_fallback.outcomes]
invoice = "process_invoice"
receipt = "process_receipt"

[pipe.process_invoice]
type = "PipeLLM"
description = "Process invoice documents"
inputs = { classification = "DocumentType" }
output = "ProcessedDocument"
prompt = """
Process this invoice document...
"""

[pipe.process_receipt]
type = "PipeLLM"
description = "Process receipt documents" 
inputs = { classification = "DocumentType" }
output = "ProcessedDocument"
prompt = """
Process this receipt document...
"""

[pipe.process_unknown]
type = "PipeLLM"
description = "Handle unknown document types"
inputs = { classification = "DocumentType" }
output = "ProcessedDocument"
prompt = """
Process this unknown document type...
"""
```

## Special outcomes: `continue` and `fail`

Beside pipe names, an outcome (or the `default_outcome`) can be one of two special outcomes:

- **`fail`**: the run fails loudly with an error naming the pipe and the evaluated expression. Use it to make "this should never happen" branches explicit.
- **`continue`**: the condition declares that it produced **no output**. The runtime records an absence for the declared output (with the evaluated expression as the reason) and the run continues as a success — the rest of the working memory is unchanged.

Because `continue` resolves the declared output as absent, a `continue`-reachable condition (any outcome mapped to `continue`, or `default_outcome = "continue"`) **must declare its output optional** — `output = "Constraint?"`. Validation enforces this statically (`optional_output_required`), so the no-output path is always visible to the type system. The same visibility rule applies at the condition's boundary: if a mapped outcome pipe declares an optional output, the condition must declare `?` too (`optional_not_handled`).

### What happens downstream of `continue`

An absent output propagates like any recorded absence:

- A downstream pipe consuming it as a **plain** input is skipped (lifted), and its own output is recorded absent in turn.
- A downstream pipe declaring the input **optional** (`?`) runs and handles both arms.
- A downstream pipe declaring the input **forced** (`!`) fails with a typed error carrying the full provenance chain.
- Inside a `PipeBatch`, an absent branch result is dropped from the aggregated list (compaction): batching a "keep or skip" condition over items yields a list of only the kept results.
- Inside a `PipeParallel`, an absent branch result is omitted from the combined output (a non-required structured field absorbs it as its default — `null` unless the field declares another default).

!!! warning "Breaking change: `continue` no longer passes the previous output through"
    `continue` used to deliver the current main stuff by passing it through. It now resolves the condition's output as **absent** instead. The previous value is not lost — it stays in the working memory under its own name, so a downstream pipe consumes it explicitly by that name (declared `?` when it may be absent). If you need "use the new value if produced, otherwise the previous one", that coalescing idiom is planned as a follow-up; today, model it with an explicit downstream pipe that declares both inputs.

```toml
[pipe.build_or_skip]
type = "PipeCondition"
description = "Builds a constraint for approved links, skips rejected ones"
inputs = { verified_link = "VerifiedLink" }
output = "Constraint?"
expression = "verified_link.verdict"
default_outcome = "continue"

[pipe.build_or_skip.outcomes]
approved = "build_single_constraint"
rejected = "continue"
```

## Expression Types

### Simple Expression
```toml
expression = "input_data.category"
```

- Direct access to working memory variables
- No template syntax needed (`{{ }}` are automatically added)
- Good for simple field access
- Access to Jinja2 filters and functions

### Complex Expression  
```toml
expression_template = "{% if input_data.score >= 70 %}high{% else %}low{% endif %}"
```

- Full Jinja2 template syntax
- Conditional logic and loops
- Complex transformations
- Multiple variable access

## Features

### Default Routing
```python
default_outcome = "process_unknown"
```

- Fallback pipe when no match is found

### Expression Aliasing
```toml
add_alias_from_expression_to = "category_type"
```

- Creates an alias from the expression result
- Makes the result available in working memory
- Requires the target to exist in working memory beforehand
