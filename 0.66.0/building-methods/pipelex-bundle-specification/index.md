# Pipelex Bundle Specification

!!! tip "MTHDS Standard Reference"
    The `.mthds` bundle format is defined by the MTHDS open standard. For the authoritative language specification, see [Bundles](https://mthds.ai/latest/language/bundles/) on mthds.ai. This page documents Pipelex-specific behavior and usage.

A **Pipelex bundle** is the fundamental unit of organization in Pipelex. It's a single `.mthds` file that defines a cohesive set of concepts and pipes for a specific domain of work.

## What is a Pipelex Bundle?

A Pipelex bundle (`.mthds` file) brings together:

- **Domain declaration** - The semantic namespace for all concepts and pipes in this bundle
- **Concepts** - The knowledge structures that flow through your pipes (optional)
- **Pipes** - The processing units that transform and manipulate your concepts (optional)

Think of a bundle as a self-contained module that solves a specific problem domain. For example, you might have:

- `invoice_processing.mthds` - Bundle for invoice extraction and validation
- `marketing.mthds` - Bundle for generating marketing content
- `document_analysis.mthds` - Bundle for analyzing documents

## Bundle Structure

Every Pipelex bundle follows this structure:

```toml
# 1. Domain Declaration (MANDATORY)
domain = "domain_code"
description = "Description of what this domain handles"

# 2. Optional: Main Pipe Declaration
main_pipe = "pipe_code"

# 3. Concept Definitions (OPTIONAL)
[concept]
ConceptName1 = "Description"
ConceptName2 = "Description"

# 4. Pipe Definitions (OPTIONAL)
[pipe]
[pipe.pipe_code]
type = "PipeLLM"
# ... pipe configuration

[pipe.pipe_code_2]
...
```

### 1. Domain Declaration (MANDATORY)

Every bundle **must** declare a domain. Only the `domain` field is mandatory; all other fields are optional:

```toml
domain = "invoice_processing"
description = "Tools for extracting and validating invoice data"
system_prompt = "You are an expert in financial document processing."
main_pipe = "extract_and_validate_invoice"
```

**Bundle Header Fields:**

- **`domain`** (required) - The unique identifier for this bundle's namespace
- **`description`** (Optional) - A human-readable description of what this bundle does
- **`system_prompt`** (Optional) - A system prompt that applies to all `PipeLLM` operators in this bundle
- **`main_pipe`** (Optional) - The default pipe to execute when no specific pipe is requested when running the bundle (see "About `main_pipe`" below)

**Why domains matter:**

- Domains create unique namespaces for your concepts and pipes
- They prevent naming conflicts when multiple bundles define concepts with the same name
- They enable organized, modular pipeline architecture

Learn more about domains in [Understanding Domains](./domain.md).

**About `system_prompt`:**

When you define a `system_prompt` at the bundle level, it automatically applies to every `PipeLLM` operator in the bundle. This is useful for setting domain-specific context:

```toml
domain = "medical_records"
system_prompt = "You are a medical records specialist with expertise in HIPAA compliance and clinical documentation."

[concept]
MedicalRecord = "A patient's medical record"
Diagnosis = "A medical diagnosis extracted from a record"

[pipe.extract_diagnosis]
type = "PipeLLM"
# This pipe will automatically use the bundle's system_prompt
description = "Extract the primary diagnosis from a medical record"
inputs = { record = "MedicalRecord" }
output = "Diagnosis"
prompt = """
Extract the primary diagnosis from this medical record:

@record
"""
```

Individual pipes can override the bundle's system prompt by defining their own `system_prompt` field.

**About `main_pipe`:**

You can specify a default pipe to execute when no specific pipe is requested:

```toml
domain = "invoice_processing"
main_pipe = "extract_and_validate_invoice"
```

**How `main_pipe` works:**

- When executing a bundle without specifying a `pipe_code`, Pipelex runs the `main_pipe`
- If no `main_pipe` is specified, you must explicitly provide the `pipe_code` when executing
- The `main_pipe` value must reference a pipe defined in the same bundle

See more about executing pipes in [Executing Pipelines](./pipes/executing-pipelines.md).

### 3. Concept Definitions (OPTIONAL)

Concepts define the knowledge structures in your domain. While optional, most bundles define at least a few concepts (See more about concepts in [Define Your Concepts](./concepts/define_your_concepts.md)):

```toml
[concept]
Invoice = "A commercial document issued by a seller to a buyer"
Vendor = "A company or individual that provides goods or services"
LineItem = "An individual item or service listed in an invoice"
```

**Concept Naming:**

Within a bundle, you reference concepts by their simple name (`Invoice`). However, their **full identifier** includes the domain code:

```
domain_code.ConceptName
```

For example, if your domain_code is `invoice_processing`, the concept `Invoice` has the full identifier:

```
invoice_processing.Invoice
```

This full identifier is how other bundles reference your concepts.

### 4. Pipe Definitions (OPTIONAL)

Pipes are the processing units that transform data. Like concepts, they're optional:

```toml
[pipe.extract_invoice]
type = "PipeExtract"
description = "Extract text and images from an invoice PDF"
inputs = { document = "Document" }
output = "Page[]"
```
See more about designing pipes in [Designing Pipelines](./pipes/index.md).

## Referencing Concepts: When to Use Domain code prefixes

Understanding when to use domain code prefixes is crucial for writing clean, maintainable bundles.

### Same-Bundle References (No Prefix Needed)

When a pipe in a bundle references a concept **defined in the same bundle**, you don't need the domain code prefix:

```toml
domain = "invoice_processing"

[concept]
Invoice = "A commercial document issued by a seller to a buyer"
ValidationResult = "Result of validating an invoice"

[pipe.validate_invoice]
type = "PipeLLM"
description = "Validate invoice data"
inputs = { invoice = "Invoice" }          # ✅ No prefix needed
output = "ValidationResult"               # ✅ No prefix needed
prompt = "Validate this invoice: $invoice"
```

This is the most common case and keeps your code clean.

### Cross-Bundle References (Prefix Required)

When a pipe references a concept **from another bundle/domain**, you must use the full domain code prefix:

```toml
domain = "accounting"

[concept]
Payment = "A financial transaction recording money transfer"
ReconciliationReport = "Report of payment reconciliation"
```

```toml
[pipe.reconcile_payment]
type = "PipeLLM"
description = "Reconcile a payment with an invoice"
inputs = { 
    invoice = "invoice_processing.Invoice",      # ✅ Different domain, needs prefix
    payment = "Payment"                          # ✅ Same domain, no prefix
}
output = "ReconciliationReport"
prompt = """
Reconcile this payment with the invoice:

@invoice

@payment
"""
```

## Bundles Working Together

One of Pipelex's strengths is how bundles can reference and build upon each other, creating modular, reusable pipeline architectures.

When you execute pipelines, multiple bundles are loaded together into a **Library** - a runtime collection that provides access to all domains, concepts, and pipes from the loaded bundles. This library system enables bundle composition and ensures proper isolation between different pipeline runs. Learn more about how libraries work in [Libraries](libraries.md).

### Calling Pipes from Other Bundles

A pipe in one bundle can call a pipe from another bundle using the full pipe identifier:

```toml
domain = "accounts_payable"

[pipe.process_vendor_invoice]
type = "PipeSequence"
description = "Process a vendor invoice end-to-end"
inputs = { pdf_document = "Document" }
output = "PaymentSchedule"
steps = [
    # Call pipe from invoice_processing domain
    { pipe = "invoice_processing.extract_invoice", result = "extracted_data" },
    
    # Call pipe from validation domain
    { pipe = "validation.validate_data", result = "validation_report" },
    
    # Call pipe from this domain (no prefix needed)
    { pipe = "schedule_payment", result = "payment_schedule" }
]

[pipe.schedule_payment]
type = "PipeLLM"
description = "Schedule payment based on invoice data"
inputs = { 
    extracted_data = "invoice_processing.Invoice",   # Concept from another domain
    validation_report = "validation.Report"           # Concept from another domain
}
output = "PaymentSchedule"
prompt = "..."
```
