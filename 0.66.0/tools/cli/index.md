# Pipelex CLI Documentation

The `pipelex` CLI is the runtime and project-configuration CLI for Pipelex. Use it to initialize config, validate methods, run pipes, inspect the runtime state, and generate supporting files.

## Installation

The CLI renders its tables, panels and log lines through Rich, which is the `cli` extra, so install the package with it:

```bash
uv tool install "pipelex[cli]"
```

The same extra serves the [`pipelex-agent`](agent-cli.md) CLI. A process that only embeds Pipelex, a server for instance, installs the package without it; see [Rich Imports](../../contribute/rich-imports.md) for what that process gives up and how the runtime keeps Rich out of it.

## Overview

The Pipelex CLI is organized into several command groups:

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| [**init**](init.md) | Initialize Pipelex configuration |
| [**update**](update.md) | Refresh the model deck to match the installed pipelex version |
| [**migrate**](migrate.md) | Bring your configuration files up to the schema the installed version expects |
| [**validate**](validate.md) | Validate configuration and pipelines |
| [**fix**](fix.md) | Apply deterministic safe fixes to a bundle and re-validate |
| [**show**](show.md) | Inspect configuration, pipes, and AI models |
| [**run**](run.md) | Execute pipelines |
| [**run method by address**](run-by-address.md) | Fetch and run a method straight from a public GitHub repository |
| [**build**](build/index.md) | Generate pipelines, runners, and structures |

## Global flags

These flags work on any `pipelex` command and are position-agnostic — place them anywhere in the invocation:

- `--traceback` - print the full Rich-rendered stack trace before the friendly one-line error. Off by default. Both `pipelex run --traceback pipe ...` and `pipelex run pipe ... --traceback` work.
- `--no-logo` - suppress the startup logo banner. Handy for clean logs and to save tokens in agent output.

`--version` / `-V` is **not** one of these: it is an option on the root command, so it goes before any subcommand (`pipelex --version`, never `pipelex show --version`). See below.

## The version handshake

`pipelex --version` reports three numbers, not one, because a client needs all three to know what it is talking to and they move on independent cadences:

```
pipelex <runtime version>
mthds-protocol <MTHDS Protocol version>
mthds-standard <MTHDS standard version>
```

- `pipelex` — the installed runtime's own version.
- `mthds-protocol` — the version of the MTHDS Protocol this runtime speaks — the request and response shapes of the runner operations.
- `mthds-standard` — the version of the [MTHDS standard](https://mthds.ai/latest/) it implements: the language, the native concept set, and what a manifest's `mthds_version` constraint is evaluated against.

`pipelex-agent --version` prints the same three lines, with `pipelex-agent` naming the first.

The shape is a contract rather than presentation: the output is exactly these three lines, each `<label> <version>`, the labels are stable, and the first line keeps the historical `<program> <version>` form. It is meant to be read by clients that drive the CLI as a subprocess and turn it into a protocol `VersionInfo` — a consumer should match on the label rather than on line position, and must not treat the whole of stdout as a single version string.

## Related CLI Surface

Package manifest management currently lives in the `mthds` CLI:

- [**package**](pkg.md) — `mthds package init`, `mthds package list`, and `mthds package validate`

## Usage Tips

1. **Initial Setup**

    - Run `pipelex init` to create configuration files and select your backends
    - Configure your AI providers in `.pipelex/inference/backends.toml`

2. **Development Workflow**

    - Write or generate pipelines in `.mthds` files
    - Validate with `pipelex validate pipe your_pipe_code` or `pipelex validate bundle your_bundle.mthds` during development
    - When validation errors carry a `💡 Suggested fix:` line, apply them automatically with `pipelex fix bundle your_bundle.mthds`
    - Run `pipelex validate pipe --all` before committing changes

3. **Running Pipelines**

    - Use `pipelex show pipe --all` to see available pipes
    - Use `pipelex show pipe pipe_code` to inspect pipe details
    - Run with `pipelex run pipe pipe_code`, add the required inputs using `--inputs`

4. **Configuration Management**

    - Use `pipelex show config` to verify current settings
    - Use `pipelex show backends` to check inference backend setup
    - Use `pipelex show models backend_name` to see available models
