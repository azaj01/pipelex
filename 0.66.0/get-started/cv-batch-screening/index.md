# CV Batch Screening, Step by Step

A production method that takes a stack of CVs and a job offer PDF, extracts and analyzes each, then scores how well each candidate matches the role. This page reads it part by part and runs it on your own machine with the Pipelex runtime, from the CLI and from Python, once you have followed [Run It Yourself](./run-it-yourself.md).

## What it demonstrates

- Typed concepts with inline structures (`CandidateProfile`, `JobRequirements`, `CandidateMatch`)
- Nested `PipeSequence` controllers, one preparing the job offer and one processing each CV
- Batching over a list of documents (`batch_over` / `batch_as`)
- Document extraction with `PipeExtract`, followed by structured analysis with `PipeLLM`

## The method: `cv_batch_screening.mthds`

### The main pipe

```toml
domain    = "cv_batch_screening"
main_pipe = "batch_analyze_cvs_for_job_offer"

[pipe.batch_analyze_cvs_for_job_offer]
type = "PipeSequence"
description = """
Main orchestrator pipe that takes a bunch of CVs and a job offer in PDF format, and analyzes how they match.
"""
inputs = { cvs = "Document[]", job_offer_pdf = "Document" }
output = "CandidateMatch[]"
steps = [
  { pipe = "prepare_job_offer", result = "job_requirements" },
  { pipe = "process_cv", batch_over = "cvs", batch_as = "cv_pdf", result = "match_analyses" },
]

## Run the method

### From the CLI

```bash
pipelex run bundle cv_batch_screening.mthds --inputs inputs.json
```

Create an `inputs.json` file with your PDF URLs:

```json
{
  "cvs": {
    "concept": "native.Document",
    "content": [
      { "url": "https://pipelex-web.s3.amazonaws.com/demo/John-Doe-CV.pdf" },
      { "url": "inputs/Jane-Smith-CV.pdf" }
    ]
  },
  "job_offer_pdf": {
    "concept": "native.Document",
    "content": {
      "url": "https://pipelex-web.s3.amazonaws.com/demo/Job-Offer.pdf"
    }
  }
}
```
