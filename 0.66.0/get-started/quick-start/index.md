Adapted from the onboarding source's front-door assembly, last re-read against the rendered file at
Pipelex/.github@50bb5ba (onboarding/rendered/front-door.md). Every paragraph and every command is a
block's own words, so a change lands in the blocks first and is then carried here. Step 3 takes the
longer first-run/agent.md rather than the assembly's agent-short.md, and the webapp and API sections
take first-run/webapp.md, key.md, first-run/api-http.md, first-run/api-typescript.md and
first-run/api-python.md, where the assembly only links to them. This page's own are the headings, the
content tabs standing in for the assembly's <details> wrappers, the sentences pointing at other pages (the SDK references are the links-tail blocks), and the closing section, since the assembly's
last block describes the runtime repository that carries it. The Python sample's inputs dict is
wrapped by this repository's ruff format, which formats Python fences in Markdown; the code is the
block's.

# Quick Start

Pipelex lets you build AI methods with your coding agent and run them anywhere: as an MCP for chatbots, as a webapp for people, or via API for your software.

## 1. Sign up

Sign up at [app.pipelex.com](https://app.pipelex.com).

## 2. Install the Pipelex plugin in your coding agent

The plugin gives your agent the skills that build methods, run them and put them in your software, a hook that checks every edit, and the Pipelex tools.

=== "Claude Code"

    ```bash
    claude plugin marketplace add Pipelex/pipelex-plugins
    claude plugin install pipelex@pipelex-plugins
    ```

    Claude Code asks for an API key when you enable the plugin, and stores it in your OS keychain — create one in your console at [app.pipelex.com](https://app.pipelex.com). The skills, the hook that checks every edit and the Pipelex tools load with it. The plugin's hook and the Pipelex tools run on Node.js, so you need Node.js on your `PATH`.

    Claude Code also loads what you have added to your Claude account, so if you added the Pipelex MCP to Claude, Claude Code has it too. An agent with the plugin does not need the Pipelex MCP, and there is nothing to turn off: when both are present, the Pipelex MCP defers to the plugin's tools.

=== "Codex"

    ```bash
    codex plugin marketplace add Pipelex/pipelex-plugins
    export PIPELEX_API_KEY=plx_sk_...     # create one in your console at app.pipelex.com
    ```

    Restart Codex, run `/plugins` to install `pipelex`, and trust the plugin hook on first run. Requires Codex 0.141 or later. The plugin's hook and the Pipelex tools run on Node.js, so you need Node.js on your `PATH`.

What the plugin holds, skill by skill, is on the [Pipelex Plugin](../features/pipelex-plugin.md) page.

## 3. Ask your agent for the method you want

> Design a method that reads an invoice PDF and returns the supplier, the total and the line items. Then run it on `~/Downloads/invoice.pdf` and save it to my Pipelex account.

`/pipelex-design` writes the method, the hook checks it on every edit, `/pipelex-inputs` gets your file ready, and `/pipelex-run` starts it and prints a run id. Come back to that id for the status, the results or the files it produced, days later if you want. `/pipelex-catalog` saves the method to your account, where your chatbot can run it too.

## Run your methods from your chatbot

The Pipelex MCP is a connector for your chatbot (ChatGPT, Claude): it gives it access to the Pipelex service, so it can list the methods saved in your account and run them right in the conversation. Your methods become your chatbot's tools. To build a method, use the Pipelex plugin in a coding agent such as Claude Code or Codex, as in steps 2 and 3 above.

Add the Pipelex MCP in your chatbot's settings by the address below — in Claude, that is **Add custom connector** — then sign in with your Pipelex account when asked. Nothing to install and no key: the Pipelex MCP runs on your signed-in session.

```
https://mcp.pipelex.com/mcp
```

Then ask your chatbot:

> What methods do I have?
>
> Run the invoice method on https://example.com/invoice.pdf

You get a run id straight away, and you can ask for its status, its results or the files it produced at any time.

Give the file as a URL the Pipelex MCP can reach. In ChatGPT you can attach it to the conversation instead and ask for a run on it; Claude has no way yet to hand the Pipelex MCP a file you attached.

## The other two ways

Your agent builds these too, and each can also be done by hand.

### As a webapp

Ask your agent for a webapp around the method, and `/pipelex-scaffold` creates a new app from the [method-app template](https://github.com/Pipelex/pipelex-method-apps) and leaves it running on your machine. By hand, the same app takes these commands:

```bash
src=$(mktemp -d)
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/Pipelex/pipelex-method-apps.git "$src"
mkdir -p my-app && cp -R "$src/webapp-js/." my-app/
cd my-app && git init

export PIPELEX_API_KEY=plx_sk_...
make create METHOD=path/to/my_method.mthds
make dev
```

The app calls Pipelex from its own server code, so it needs a key of its own — create one in your console at [app.pipelex.com](https://app.pipelex.com). `METHOD` is a `.mthds` file, a directory of them, a method id from your catalog (`mt_…`), or a published address. The form and the result view are rendered from the method's own contract, so adding a method writes no form fields.

### Via API

Ask your agent to call the method from your TypeScript or Python code, and `/pipelex-integrate` generates the method's types and one typed call that runs it, through the TypeScript SDK [`@pipelex/sdk`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pipelex/sdk) or the Python SDK [`pipelex-sdk`](https://pypi.org/project/pipelex-sdk/). By hand, any software runs a method via API through `POST /v1/start`, with either SDK or with any HTTP client.

Create an API key in your console at [app.pipelex.com](https://app.pipelex.com) and give it to your program as `PIPELEX_API_KEY` — the only thing to configure, since `PIPELEX_BASE_URL` already points at the hosted API.

```bash
export PIPELEX_API_KEY=plx_sk_...
```

=== "HTTP"

    ```bash
    curl -s https://api.pipelex.com/v1/start \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer $PIPELEX_API_KEY" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{
        "method_ref": "github.com/Pipelex/methods/invoice_extraction@v0.1.1",
        "inputs": {"document": {"url": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Pipelex/pipelex-cookbook/main/assets/extract_proof_of_purchase/restaurant_invoice.pdf", "mime_type": "application/pdf"}}
      }'
    # 202 → {"pipeline_run_id": "..."}

    RUN_ID=...     # the pipeline_run_id the start returned
    curl -s https://api.pipelex.com/v1/runs/$RUN_ID/results \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer $PIPELEX_API_KEY"
    ```

    The start returns immediately and the run is durable — poll the results route, or fetch them hours later by the same id.

=== "TypeScript"

    ```bash
    npm install @pipelex/sdk
    ```

    ```ts
    import { PipelexApiClient } from "@pipelex/sdk";

    const client = new PipelexApiClient({ apiKey: process.env.PIPELEX_API_KEY });

    const result = await client.startAndWaitForResult({
      method_ref: "github.com/Pipelex/methods/invoice_extraction@v0.1.1",
      inputs: {
        document: { url: "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Pipelex/pipelex-cookbook/main/assets/extract_proof_of_purchase/restaurant_invoice.pdf", mime_type: "application/pdf" },
      },
    });

    console.log(result.main_stuff);
    ```

=== "Python"

    ```bash
    pip install pipelex-sdk
    ```

    ```python
    import asyncio

    from pipelex_sdk.client import PipelexAPIClient


    async def main() -> None:
        async with PipelexAPIClient() as client:
            result = await client.start_and_wait(
                method_ref="github.com/Pipelex/methods/invoice_extraction@v0.1.1",
                inputs={
                    "document": {
                        "url": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Pipelex/pipelex-cookbook/main/assets/extract_proof_of_purchase/restaurant_invoice.pdf",
                        "mime_type": "application/pdf",
                    }
                },
            )
            print(result.main_stuff)


    asyncio.run(main())
    ```

## Prefer to run it yourself?

The Pipelex runtime runs your methods on your own machine, against the model providers you choose. [Run It Yourself](./run-it-yourself.md) installs it, and [The MTHDS Language Tutorial](./mthds-language-tutorial.md) walks through writing a method by hand.
