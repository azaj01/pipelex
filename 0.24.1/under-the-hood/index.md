# Under the Hood

Welcome to the technical deep-dives of Pipelex. This section is for contributors, curious developers, AI agents, and anyone doing due diligence on how Pipelex works internally.

## What You'll Find Here

- **Architecture Overview** - The two-layer design and how components fit together
- **Execution Graph Tracing** - How pipeline executions are captured as graphs for visualization
- **Image Handling in LLM Prompts** - How images flow from inputs to LLM calls
- **Reasoning Controls** - How reasoning effort/budget flows to each provider's SDK
- **StuffArtefact & Image Rendering** - How template access and image extraction work
- **Test Profile Configuration** - How to configure which models are used in tests
- **Dry Run Mock Generation** - How mock objects satisfy field validation constraints
- **Init CLI Flows** - How `pipelex init` sets up the configuration directory
- **Technical Design Decisions** - Why we chose X over Y
- **Module Deep-Dives** - Detailed explanations of specific subsystems

!!! info "Not Required for Using Pipelex"
    You don't need to read this section to use Pipelex effectively. The [Home](../index.md) section covers everything you need to build methods.
