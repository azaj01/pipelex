# Example: Hello World

This is the "Hello World" of Pipelex, a simple pipeline that demonstrates the basic concepts of Pipelex.

It's the perfect starting point to verify your installation and get a first taste of how Pipelex works.

## What it demonstrates

- Minimal Pipelex setup with a single `PipeLLM` pipe
- The `main_pipe` field to designate the entry point
- Running a method bundle from the CLI

## The Method: `hello_world.mthds`

The method definition is extremely simple — a single LLM call that generates a haiku:

```toml
domain    = "quick_start"
main_pipe = "hello_world"

[pipe]
[pipe.hello_world]
type = "PipeLLM"
description = "Write text about Hello World."
output = "Text"
prompt = """
Write a haiku about Hello World.
"""
```

## How to run

1. Clone the cookbook repository and install dependencies:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Pipelex/pipelex-cookbook.git
    cd pipelex-cookbook
    pip install .
    ```

2. Set up your environment variables by copying `.env.example` to `.env` and adding your API keys.

3. Run the example:

    ```bash
    pipelex run bundle examples/a_quick_start/hello_world.mthds
    ```

Expected output: A haiku about "Hello World" displayed with pretty formatting.
