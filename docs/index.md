# What is Pipelex?

Pipelex is an open-source language that enables agents to build and run **repeatable AI workflows**. Instead of cramming everything into one complex prompt, you break tasks into focused steps, each pipe handling one clear transformation.

Each pipe processes information using **Concepts** (typing with meaning) to ensure your pipelines make sense. The Pipelex language (`.plx` files) is simple and human-readable, even for non-technical users.

Each step can be structured and validated, so you benefit from the reliability of software, and the intelligence of AI.

## Key Features

### 🔄 Repeatable AI Workflows
Build workflows that produce consistent, reliable results every time they run.

### 🧩 Concept-Driven Design
Use semantic typing (Concepts) to ensure each step of your pipeline makes sense and connects logically.

### 📝 Human-Readable Language
Write workflows in `.plx` files that are easy to read, edit, and maintain—even for non-developers.

### 🤖 AI-Assisted Development
Generate and iterate on workflows using natural language with your favorite AI coding assistant.

### 🔧 Production-Ready
Validate, test, and deploy AI workflows with the same confidence as traditional software.

## Why Pipelex?

Traditional AI applications often struggle with:

- **Complexity**: One massive prompt trying to do everything
- **Unpredictability**: Different results each time
- **Maintenance**: Hard to debug and improve
- **Collaboration**: Difficult for teams to work together

Pipelex solves these problems by:

- **Breaking down complexity** into focused, manageable steps
- **Ensuring consistency** through structured validation
- **Enabling iteration** with clear, editable workflows
- **Facilitating collaboration** with human-readable syntax
