# Example: Synthetic Data Generation

This example generates diverse synthetic data samples from a text description. It first identifies a comprehensive set of sample cases, then creates detailed profiles for each one.

## What it demonstrates

- Concept refinement (`DataDescription` refines `Text`, `NbOfSamples` refines `Number`)
- Rich structured concept with constrained choices (`Sample` with `current_performance`, `learns_best_with`, etc.)
- Two-step generation: identify diverse cases, then create a profile for each
- Batching over identified cases to generate samples in parallel

## The Method: `bundle.mthds`

### Sample concept

The `Sample` concept represents a student profile with constrained fields:

```toml
[concept.Sample]
description = "A complete synthetic data record representing a student profile."

[concept.Sample.structure]
student_name = { type = "text", description = "The name of the student", required = true }
current_performance = { type = "text", description = "The student's current performance level", choices = [
  "Struggling", "Average", "Advanced",
], required = true }
learns_best_with = { type = "text", description = "The learning modality that works best", choices = [
  "Visual examples", "Step-by-step text", "Hands-on practice", "Videos",
], required = true }
# ... pace, complexity, strengths, needs_help_with, etc.
```

### Pipeline

```toml
[pipe.generate_synthetic_data_samples]
type = "PipeSequence"
inputs = { data_description = "DataDescription", nb_samples = "NbOfSamples" }
output = "Sample[]"
steps = [
  { pipe = "identify_sample_cases", result = "cases" },
  { pipe = "create_profile_for_case", result = "samples",
    batch_over = "cases", batch_as = "case_characterization" },
]
```

The first step identifies diverse real-world scenarios to ensure comprehensive coverage (edge cases, common scenarios, important variations). The second step creates a full profile for each case.

## How to run

```bash
pipelex run bundle examples/c_advanced/gen_synthetic_data/bundle.mthds \
  -i examples/c_advanced/gen_synthetic_data/inputs.json
```
