# Observer Data Extraction

The Observer system in Pipelex automatically collects execution data from your pipes for later analysis. This data extraction feature is currently a work in progress but provides valuable insights into pipeline performance, usage patterns, and debugging information.

## Data Collection Points

The observer extracts data at three critical moments during pipe execution:

### 1. Before Pipe Execution
- **When**: Just before a pipe starts running
- **Data Collected**: Initial working memory state, pipe configuration, input parameters... [WIP]
- **Purpose**: Capture the starting conditions and context for analysis

### 2. After Successful Execution
- **When**: When a pipe completes successfully
- **Data Collected**: Final working memory, outputs, execution metadata, performance metrics... [WIP]
- **Purpose**: Track successful operations and measure performance

### 3. After Failed Execution
- **When**: When a pipe encounters an error or exception
- **Data Collected**: Error context, partial results, failure metadata... [WIP]
- **Purpose**: Debug issues and analyze failure patterns

## Where Data is Stored

The data extraction location depends on your observer implementation:

### LocalObserver (opt-in)

Pipelex ships a `LocalObserver` that writes each event to JSONL files on the local filesystem, but it is not registered by default: out of the box, setup wires a no-op observer and a telemetry observer, so no JSONL files are written. To enable JSONL extraction, construct a `LocalObserver` and pass it through the `observers` parameter of `Pipelex.make()` (a mapping of name to observer — note that providing it replaces the default observers):

```python
from pipelex.observer.local_observer import LocalObserver
from pipelex.pipelex import Pipelex

Pipelex.make(observers={"local": LocalObserver(storage_dir="results/observer")})
```

Pass an explicit `storage_dir`: the observer is constructed before `Pipelex.make()` boots the runtime, so it cannot read the configured default at that point.

Once registered:

- **Location**: Local filesystem in JSONL format
- **Default Directory**: if you omit `storage_dir`, the directory comes from `observer_config.observer_dir` in your Pipelex settings — but that fallback only works once Pipelex is booted, not in the pre-boot construction shown above
- **Files Created**:

- `before_run.jsonl` - Pre-execution snapshots
- `after_successful_run.jsonl` - Success events and results
- `after_failing_run.jsonl` - Failure events and error context

### Custom Observers
You can implement custom data extraction to:

- **Databases**: PostgreSQL, MongoDB, InfluxDB for structured analysis
- **Cloud Storage**: S3, GCS for large-scale data retention
- **Streaming Systems**: Kafka, Redis for real-time processing
- **Monitoring Tools**: DataDog, New Relic for operational insights
